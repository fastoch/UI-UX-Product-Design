## Designer vs Developer

A designer is focused on the aesthetics, and on the user experience as a whole.  
A developer is focused more on the internals (what we don't see), and on the things that make a product work.  

The first phase of building any product is **the planning phase**. This phase is probably **the most important**.  
This is the part where you interact with the client to determine what they need, what the end product should do and look like.  

From the planning phase, we move to **the design phase**.  
The design phase is all about using all the information produced during the planning phase, and making it into reality.  

From the design phase, we get into the development phase.  
The development phase is where we do the programming/coding work.  
We take all the assets and information that we've gathered from the previous stage, and we try to implement it on a website, or a web app.
