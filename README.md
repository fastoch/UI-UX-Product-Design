## Designer vs Developer

A designer is focused on the aesthetics, and on the user experience as a whole.  
A developer is focused more on the internals (what we don't see), and on the things that make a product work.  

The first phase of building any product is **the planning phase**. This phase is probably **the most important**.  
This is the part where you interact with the client to determine what they need, what the end product should do and look like.  

From the planning phase, we move to **the design phase**.  
The design phase is all about using all the information produced during the planning phase, and making it into reality.  

From the design phase, we get into **the development phase**.  
The development phase is where we do the programming/coding work.  
We take all the assets and information that we've gathered from the previous stage, and we implement it on a web or mobile app.  

Once we've built the product, then we get into **the launch phase**. This is where we deliver our product to the users.  
Usually, there's some polishing we need to do, which is why the process doesn't end here.  

The next step is **the post-launch phase**. We handed off the product to our client, and we need to monitor how the launch goes.  
Do the users face any issues? How could we improve the product and deliver a better version?  

And this turns into a **loop**, because from the insights that we get after the launch, we can now start improving our product.  
We can start planning again, designing again, and implementing the changes... You can never really finish a product.  

- Plan
- Design
- Develop
- Deploy
- Get feedback
- Rinse & Repeat

## Skills to be a top designer

There are 4 key elements to designing:
- Graphic Design: colors, layout, typography, sketching
- User Experience (UX): understanding your customer
- Goal Conversion: motivating the visitors to use your web app, to buy your products or services, to subscribe
- Platform Development: knowing how the platform you're designing for works, be it a web app, a mobile app or anything else

As a designer, we need to look for the best resources available online. There's a ton of great resources out there that will ease our job.  

# Sketching

## Intro

Sketching is a two step process:
- idea generation: as many as we can, under the form of sketches
- adding detail and refinement: refining our sketches, then adding more detail

In step 2, the point is to kill some of our ideas.  

## From idea generation to refinement 

Ideas must be turned into initial sketches, which have lower level details, and usually no colors.  
The goal here is to draw a ot of basic sketches.  

From here, we're going to start refining and adding some details.  
We can start making **wireframes** at this point.  

The next step is to transform our wireframes into something more organized and functional, into actual **components**.  

## The Sketching Process

- What are your **goals**?
- Who is your **audience**?
- Keep yourself under a **time limit**
- Start sketching
- Draw a **frame** for the targeted device
- If multiple devices, go **mobile first**, it's easier to then adjust to bigger screen sizes
- Start with basic elements and those that are **redundant** (header, footer, navigation bar, etc.)
- Move onto some more **detailed interactions** throught annotations and **arrows**
- **Annotate** your sketches so anyone can understand them, and keep them **safe**
- **Share** your sketches so you can get **feedback** from your friends or coworkers
- Add **titles** to your sketches
- You can even try numbering your sketches if you think it's relevant, it might help understand a workflow

# Intro to Figma

## Layers

In Figma, a layer is any individual design element—such as a shape, text, image, frame, or group—that you add to your canvas.  
Each object you create is automatically represented as its own layer in the Layers panel on the left side of the interface.  
This panel displays all layers in your file, organized so you can select, arrange, and manage each element independently.  

Layers are visually **stacked** from top to bottom in the Layers panel.  
The layer at the top appears in front of all others in your design.   
You can change the stacking (overlapping) order by dragging layers up or down.

## Groups

In Figma, a group is a basic way to combine multiple elements so you can manage and manipulate them as a single unit.  
This is particularly useful for keeping your designs organized and making it easier to move, resize, or edit several objects at once.

## Frames

Frames can act as a scaffolding for a specific device or screen size, like a single page in an app design.  
They can also act as containers for layers that make up distinct elements, like the layers in a navigation bar.  



## Sections


## Components

Components are **reusable** design elements—such as buttons, icons, forms, cards, or even entire layouts—that you can use across your projects to maintain consistency and efficiency.   

Once you create a component, you can generate multiple instances (copies) of it throughout your designs.   
When you update the main (master) component, all instances automatically reflect those changes, making global updates fast and reliable.
